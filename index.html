Hello! Welcome to my website where I will be posting my notes.

13th of January 2022.
It is the beginning of the new year. Isn't it funny how some we all feel a sense of relief, that last year has ended. Perhaps you feel that a huge weight has been 
lifted of your shoulders. This was merely done through the passing of time. 365 days ticked over, and now we can sense a fresh start. Leave the old things in the
past and now set out on new endeavours and goals we have set for this new year. 

Nevertheless, I also engaged in this period for self-reflection and have set out future goals that I wish to carry out and achieve for the new year. I think it 
is important that you are able to reflect on each year as it provides valuable lessons. Regardless of whether you were able to achieve your goals you set, or if you
failed, the latter can sometimes be more important. It is always your first pain lessons that teaches you the most, and so I wish to learn to embrace these lessons 
alot more now. 

2022 Goals.
- Read alot and read widely. I have realised ever since finishing highschool, I had lost my habit of reading books. Yes I read the news alot, and social media 
platforms but there is something so pure about reading from a paper book that leaves you feeling a sense of achievement after you've finished. It is also
a whole lot less distracting. 
- Write out my thoughts and improve my vocabulary!
- Become more articulate with my ideas and be able to express myself in a much more clear and concise manner.
- Keep running and testing your mental grit.
- Do not neglect this blog site! :)

I wish the best for everyone in 2022! Let's have a great year.
